# draftsim — auction draft simulator (research harness)

Deterministic, headless auction-draft simulator for comparing strategy
archetypes. Programmed agents only (no LLM). Reuses the exported projections in
`../data/projections-2026.csv` and mirrors the auction rules from the TS
`domain/` layer.

Built in stages (each with its own tests + a review gate):

1. **Scaffold + valuation** — load players, value models (market $PROJ / VORP).
2. **Auction + roster rules** (ported from `domain/`).
3. **Deterministic engine + a basic agent.** ← current
4. Archetypes + behavior tests.
5. Metrics + batch analysis.

## Setup

```bash
cd sim
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run

```bash
python -m pytest                    # tests
python -m draftsim.inspect          # Stage 1 sanity: top players by each value model
python scripts/simulate.py --seed 1 # Stage 3: run one draft; rerun -> byte-identical
```

## How a draft runs (Stage 3)

`engine.run_draft(agents, config, players)` plays a nomination-style auction:
each round one manager (fixed seat rotation, skipping full rosters) nominates a
player, every manager with room submits a **sealed** bid, highest wins and pays
it (first-price, per `domain/auction.ts`). The nominator opens at `MIN_BID`, so
every round removes one player and the draft always terminates. It's a pure
function of its inputs — same agents + seed ⇒ identical `DraftResult`.

The one agent so far, `HeuristicAgent`, is a need-aware value bidder anchored on
market price with deterministic per-seat jitter. Two rails keep every roster
legal: the budget **reserve** (`max_bid`/`can_bid`) and a **slot rail** (never
spend a slot on depth while an unmet starter need still claims it). Archetype
personalities are Stage 4 — parameter presets of this same class.
