# draftsim — auction draft simulator (research harness)

Deterministic, headless auction-draft simulator for comparing strategy
archetypes. Programmed agents only (no LLM). Reuses the exported projections in
`../data/projections-2026.csv` and mirrors the auction rules from the TS
`domain/` layer.

Built in stages (each with its own tests + a review gate):

1. **Scaffold + valuation** — load players, value models (market $PROJ / VORP). ← current
2. Auction + roster rules (ported from `domain/`).
3. Deterministic engine + a basic agent.
4. Archetypes + behavior tests.
5. Metrics + batch analysis.

## Setup

```bash
cd sim
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run

```bash
python -m pytest              # tests
python -m draftsim.inspect    # Stage 1 sanity: top players by each value model
```
